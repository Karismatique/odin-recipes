    <p>Oeufs Mimosa also known as Devilled Eggs are a wonderful appetizer to celebrate the arrival of spring! This version is topped with smoked salmon & capers for a twist on a classic dijon devilled egg.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup quality mayonnaise </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Step</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with cold water & add the eggs. Bring to a boil & remove from heat. Cover with lid & let stand for 10 minutes. Immediately strain into an ice bath.</li>
