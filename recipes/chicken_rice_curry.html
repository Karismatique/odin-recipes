    <p>I've been loving the subtle spice from curry lately, so I incorporated it into this saucy chicken and rice dish. It's a one-pan meal that's become a go-to dinnertime favorite.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 can (14-1/2 ounces) reduced-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked instant rice</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh cilantro leaves, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat; saute onion until tender and lightly browned, 3-5 minutes. Remove from pan.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix flour and seasonings; toss with chicken. In same skillet, heat remaining butter over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook just until no longer pink, 4-6 minutes, turning occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir in broth and onion; bring to a boil. Stir in rice. Remove from heat; let stand, covered, 5 minutes (mixture will be saucy). If desired, sprinkle with cilantro.</li>
        <li>When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, keeping them warm in a low oven as you go.</li>
    </ol>
